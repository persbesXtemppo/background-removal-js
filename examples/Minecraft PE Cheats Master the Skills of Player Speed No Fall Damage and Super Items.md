## How to Increase Your Player Speed in Minecraft PE
 
One of the most useful cheats in Minecraft PE is to increase your player speed, which can help you travel faster, escape from enemies or catch up with your friends. There are two ways to do this: using commands or using mods.
 
### Using Commands
 
If you have cheats enabled in your world settings, you can use commands to change your player speed. To do this, open the chat window by tapping the chat icon on the top of the screen. Then type the following command:
 `/effect @s speed [duration] [amplifier]` 
The duration is the number of seconds that you want the effect to last, and the amplifier is the level of the effect. For example, if you want to have super speed for 10 seconds, type:
 `/effect @s speed 10 255` 
This will give you the maximum level of speed for 10 seconds. You can also use negative values for the amplifier to reduce your speed. For example, if you want to slow down for 5 seconds, type:
 `/effect @s speed 5 -1` 
To remove the effect, type:
 `/effect @s clear` 
### Using Mods
 
If you don't have cheats enabled in your world settings, or if you want to have more control over your player speed, you can use mods that can modify your game files. Mods are third-party applications or programs that can add new features or change existing ones in Minecraft PE. However, installing mods may require rooting or jailbreaking your device, which may void your warranty or expose your device to security risks. You should always download mods from trusted sources and scan them for viruses or malware before installing them.
 
One of the most popular mods for increasing player speed in Minecraft PE is Speed Hack Mod by Desno365. This mod allows you to adjust your player speed by using a slider in the game settings. You can also toggle sprinting and flying modes with this mod. To install this mod, follow these steps:
