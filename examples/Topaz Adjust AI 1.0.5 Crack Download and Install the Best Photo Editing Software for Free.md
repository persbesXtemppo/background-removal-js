### HDR Mode
 
HDR mode is a mode that allows you to create stunning high dynamic range (HDR) images from a single photo. HDR mode uses a proprietary AI engine called Topaz HDR to analyze your photo and apply optimal tone mapping and contrast enhancement for each pixel.
 
HDR mode can create realistic or artistic HDR effects depending on your preference. You can adjust the strength, color, and detail of the HDR effect with simple sliders. You can also choose from a variety of presets that are designed for different types of HDR images, such as natural, dramatic, grunge, and more.
 
### Stylize Mode
 
Stylize mode is a mode that allows you to apply artistic filters and effects to your photos with one click. Stylize mode uses a proprietary AI engine called Topaz Impression to analyze your photo and apply optimal brush strokes and textures for each pixel.
 
Stylize mode can create painterly or sketchy effects depending on your preference. You can adjust the style, color, and detail of the stylized effect with simple sliders. You can also choose from a variety of presets that are inspired by famous artists and styles, such as Van Gogh, Monet, watercolor, charcoal, and more.
