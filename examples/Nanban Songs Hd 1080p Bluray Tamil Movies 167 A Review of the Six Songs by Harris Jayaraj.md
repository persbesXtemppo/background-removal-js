Nanban is a film that entertains as well as enlightens the viewers with its humorous, heartfelt and inspiring story. It is a film that celebrates friendship, learning and life.
  
The film begins with Venkat Ramakrishnan (Srikanth), a wildlife photographer, receiving a call from his college mate Srivatsan (Sathyan), who claims to know the whereabouts of their long-lost friend Panchavan "Pari" Pariventhan (Vijay). Venkat meets up with another friend, Sevarkodi Senthil (Jiiva), who works as a software engineer, and they rush to their alma mater, Ideal Engineering College (IEC), to meet Srivatsan. There, they recall their college days and how Pari changed their lives.
 
In a flashback, it is shown that Venkat, Senthil and Pari joined IEC as engineering students, despite having different interests and aspirations. They faced the wrath of their strict and arrogant director Dr. Virumandi Santhanam (Sathyaraj), nicknamed Virus by the students, who believed in rote learning and academic excellence. Pari, on the other hand, was a free-spirited and brilliant student who loved learning and innovation. He challenged Virus's methods and helped his friends overcome their fears and problems. He also fell in love with Riya (Ileana D'Cruz), Virus's daughter, who was a medical student.
 
The film depicts various incidents that happened during their college life, such as Pari helping Venkat deliver a baby in an ambulance, Pari and Senthil crashing Riya's wedding to stop her from marrying a greedy doctor, Pari exposing the corruption of an education minister who tried to shut down IEC, and Pari inventing a drone camera that won him an award. However, Pari also faced some troubles, such as being expelled from the college for hacking Virus's computer, being accused of stealing an exam paper by Srivatsan, who was Virus's pet student and rival of Pari, and being blamed for the suicide of Joy Lobo (S.J. Suryah), a talented student who was depressed after Virus rejected his project.
 
After graduation, Pari disappeared without a trace, leaving his friends clueless about his fate. Ten years later, Srivatsan reveals that he saw Pari in Ooty and challenges Venkat and Senthil to find him before he does. The three friends embark on a road trip to Ooty, where they encounter various surprises and revelations that change their lives forever.
