# How to Upgrade Your Xbox 360 Hard Drive with HDDSS.BIN
 
If you want to increase the storage capacity of your Xbox 360 console, you can replace the original hard drive with a larger one. However, you will need to flash the new hard drive with a security sector file called HDDSS.BIN, which contains information about the drive model, size and firmware. This file is unique for each hard drive and must match the Xbox 360 specifications.
 
In this article, we will show you how to flash your HDDSS.BIN file in Windows using a hex editor and a SATA connection. You will need the following items:

- A new hard drive compatible with Xbox 360. You can use any size up to 2 TB, but you will need a matching HDDSS.BIN file for it. You can find some HDDSS.BIN files for different sizes here[^1^].
- A computer running Windows.
- A hex editor, such as Hex Workshop[^2^].
- A SATA cable or adapter to connect your hard drive to your computer.
- A bit of common sense.

Follow these steps to flash your HDDSS.BIN file:

1. Backup any data on your new hard drive, as it will be erased during the process.
2. Connect your new hard drive to your computer using the SATA cable or adapter.
3. Open the hex editor and select your new hard drive from the list of drives.
4. Open the HDDSS.BIN file that matches your hard drive size in the hex editor.
5. Select all the data in the HDDSS.BIN file (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C).
6. Go back to your new hard drive in the hex editor and paste the data at the beginning of the drive (Ctrl+V).
7. Save the changes to your new hard drive (Ctrl+S) and close the hex editor.
8. Disconnect your new hard drive from your computer and install it in your Xbox 360 console.
9. Turn on your Xbox 360 and enjoy your upgraded storage space.

Note: This method only works for Xbox 360 consoles that have been modified with a custom firmware (CFW) or a reset glitch hack (RGH). If you have a stock console, you will need to use a special tool called Xplorer360 to flash your HDDSS.BIN file. You can find more information about Xplorer360 here.
