The first thing you need to do is to download the IW4PLAY client from their official website: [https://iw4play.neocities.org/](https://iw4play.neocities.org/). You will find two versions of the client: one for Windows and one for Linux. Choose the one that suits your operating system and click on the download button.

Double-click on "LaunchBO.exe" and wait for it to load. You will see a window with some options and settings. You can change the language, resolution, graphics quality and other preferences as you wish. You can also create an account or log in with an existing one if you want to save your progress and stats.
 
## Step 3: Join a Server
 
Once you are done with the launcher settings, you are ready to join a server and play Black Ops online. To do that, click on the "Play" button at the bottom right corner of the launcher window. You will see a list of servers available for both multiplayer and zombies modes.
