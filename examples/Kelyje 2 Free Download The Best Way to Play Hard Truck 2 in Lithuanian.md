## Kelyje 2: Tips and Tricks to Become a Successful Truck Driver
 
Kelyje 2 is not just a game of driving, but also a game of strategy and management. You have to plan your routes, manage your finances, upgrade your truck, hire helpers and compete with other drivers. Here are some tips and tricks to help you become a successful truck driver in Kelyje 2:

- Choose your truck wisely. Different trucks have different advantages and disadvantages, such as speed, fuel consumption, cargo capacity, durability and price. You should choose a truck that suits your style and budget. For example, if you want to deliver fast and light cargoes, you might want to choose a Mercedes-Benz or a Volvo. If you want to deliver heavy and bulky cargoes, you might want to choose a ZIL or a KAMAZ.
- Upgrade your truck regularly. You can improve your truck's performance and appearance by buying new parts and accessories. You can buy engines, transmissions, tires, suspensions, brakes, horns, lights, paint jobs and more. Upgrading your truck will make it faster, more reliable, more comfortable and more attractive.
- Manage your fuel and repairs. You have to keep an eye on your fuel gauge and your damage indicator. If you run out of fuel or if your truck breaks down, you will lose time and money. You can refuel at gas stations or buy fuel tanks at shops. You can repair your truck at garages or buy repair kits at shops.
- Hire helpers. You can hire other drivers to work for you and deliver cargoes for you. You can find them at bars or hotels. You have to pay them a salary and a commission for each delivery. Hiring helpers will increase your income and reputation.
- Compete with other drivers. You are not alone on the road. There are other drivers who are also delivering cargoes and trying to make money. You can challenge them to races or duels for money or cargo. You can also sabotage them by blocking their way, ramming them or stealing their cargo.
- Follow the rules of the road. You have to obey the traffic laws and avoid getting caught by the police. If you speed, run red lights, drive on the wrong side of the road or cause accidents, you will get fined or arrested. You can also lose your license if you accumulate too many violations.
