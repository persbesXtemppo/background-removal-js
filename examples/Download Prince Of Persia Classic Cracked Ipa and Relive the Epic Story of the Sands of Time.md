- Learn how to run and jump. Running and jumping are essential skills in this game, as you will need them to cross gaps, avoid traps and reach higher places. To run, press and hold the direction button. To jump, press the jump button while running. You can also jump while standing still, but you will not cover as much distance. You can also control your direction while in mid-air by pressing the direction button.
- Learn how to fight. Fighting is another important skill in this game, as you will encounter many guards and other enemies that will try to stop you. To fight, press the attack button while facing an enemy. You can also block their attacks by pressing the defend button. You can also parry their attacks by pressing the attack button at the right moment. Parrying will stun your enemy and give you a chance to strike back.

- Learn how to use your environment. The environment is your friend and your foe in this game. You can use it to your advantage or suffer from its hazards. You can use switches, levers, gates, platforms and other objects to open paths, access secrets and solve puzzles. You can also use spikes, pits, blades, fire and other traps to kill your enemies or avoid them. Be careful though, as these traps can also kill you if you are not careful.
- Learn how to save your progress. Saving your progress is crucial in this game, as you only have one life and a limited amount of time to complete it. To save your progress, you need to find a potion bottle that has a blue glow around it. These bottles are hidden throughout the levels and are usually guarded by enemies or traps. Once you find one, drink it by pressing the action button near it. This will create a checkpoint that you can return to if you die or restart the game.
- Learn how to use cheats and secrets. Cheats and secrets are optional features that can make your game easier or more fun. To use cheats, you need to enter a code on the main menu screen before starting a new game or loading a saved game. Some of the codes are: 4-1-2-2 (start with sword), 1-3-4-1 (start with 15 minutes), 2-2-1-1 (start at level 2), 3-4-4-3 (start at level 3) and 4-3-2-1 (start at level 4).
