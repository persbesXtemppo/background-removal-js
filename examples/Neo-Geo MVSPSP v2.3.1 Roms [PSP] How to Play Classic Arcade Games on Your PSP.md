MVSPSP is a PSP port of the Neo-Geo emulator MAME4ALL. It supports most of the Neo-Geo games and runs them smoothly on PSP models 1000 to 3000. However, it does not work on the PSP Go or the PSP E1000. To use MVSPSP, you will need a custom firmware (CFW) on your PSP and some Neo-Geo roms.
 
Here are the steps to install and use MVSPSP on your PSP:
 
1. Download the latest version of MVSPSP from [here](https://github.com/Nzaki0716/MVSPSP/releases). You will get two zip files: one for the emulator (MVSPSP) and one for the cache tool (cache).
2. Extract the zip files and copy the folders to your PSP memory stick. The MVSPSP folder goes to PSP/GAME and the cache folder goes to PSP/GAME150.
3. Download some Neo-Geo roms from [here](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_%28Full_Sets_in_One_File%29_ROMs/NeoGeo_%28NeoRAGEx%29_5.0/96214) or other sources. Make sure they are compatible with MVSPSP by checking [this list](https://github.com/Nzaki0716/MVSPSP/blob/master/compatibility.txt).
4. Extract the roms and copy them to a folder named ROMS inside the MVSPSP folder on your PSP memory stick.
5. Run the cache tool from your PSP game menu. It will scan your roms and create cache files for them. This may take some time depending on how many roms you have.
6. Run the MVSPSP emulator from your PSP game menu. You will see a list of your roms. Select one and press X to start playing.
7. You can adjust the settings of the emulator by pressing SELECT during gameplay. You can change the screen size, sound volume, button mapping, cheats, and more.
