However, many fans were disappointed that the game did not include the Buu Saga, which is the final arc of the original Dragon Ball Z anime. They also wished for more characters, stages, and modes to enhance the gameplay experience. That's why some dedicated modders decided to create Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit 2, a fan-made project that aims to improve and expand the original game.
 
Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit 2 is a mod that adds new content and features to the base game. It includes the Buu Saga, with new story scenes, battles, and characters such as Majin Buu, Super Saiyan 3 Goku, and Vegito. It also adds more characters from other Dragon Ball media, such as Broly, Bardock, and Cooler. The mod also introduces new stages, such as the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Planet Namek, and Hell. Additionally, the mod enhances the graphics, sound effects, and gameplay mechanics of the original game.
 
The mod is not officially endorsed by the developers or publishers of Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit. It is a fan-made project that requires a modded PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 console to run. The mod is also not available for download on any official website or platform. The only way to get it is to contact the modders directly through their YouTube channel or social media accounts.
 
Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit 2 is a testament to the passion and creativity of the Dragon Ball fan community. It is a mod that offers a fresh and exciting experience for fans of the classic fighting game. If you are interested in trying it out, you can watch some gameplay videos on YouTube[^1^] or follow the modders on Twitter[^2^] for more updates.

Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit 2 is not the only fan-made mod for a Dragon Ball game. There are many other projects that aim to enhance or modify existing Dragon Ball games, such as Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. These mods add new characters, costumes, stages, moves, and features to the games, making them more diverse and fun to play. Some of these mods are available for download on websites such as Nexus Mods or Mod DB, while others are exclusive to certain modders or communities.
 
However, fan-made mods are not the only way to enjoy Dragon Ball games. There are also many official Dragon Ball games that have been released over the years, spanning various genres and platforms. Some of the most popular and acclaimed Dragon Ball games include Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z, Dragon Ball Legends, and Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle. These games offer different gameplay styles and features, such as 3D fighting, RPG elements, card-based battles, and online multiplayer.
