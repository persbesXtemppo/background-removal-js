One of the most impressive features of the Traktor S4 is the integration with Traktor's Remix Decks and Stems. Remix Decks let you load up to 64 loops and samples per deck, and trigger them with the 16 RGB pads. You can also use the pads to create hotcues, beatjumps, and loops on the fly. Stems are a new format that splits a track into four parts: drums, bass, vocals, and melody. You can mix and manipulate these parts independently with the faders and knobs on the controller, creating new mashups and remixes on the spot.
 
The Traktor S4 is not only a controller, but also a high-quality audio interface with 24-bit/96 kHz resolution. It has four stereo outputs, two stereo inputs, two mic inputs, two headphone outputs, and a USB port. You can connect turntables or CDJs to use timecode vinyl or CDs for DVS control, or use them as external sources. You can also route audio from other software or hardware through the S4's mixer. The controller is USB-powered, but you can also use an optional power supply to increase the brightness of the LEDs[^1^].

The Traktor S4 is not only a powerful and versatile controller, but also a platform for creativity and customization. There are many ways to tweak and hack the S4 to suit your style and preferences. Here are some of the best tips and tricks for Traktor S4 users.
 
One of the most popular hacks is to modify the screens on the controller to display more information and visual feedback. For example, you can use Joe Easton's screen hack[^1^] to get larger, spectrum-style waveforms, color-coding for each deck, pitch, key, and BPM information, as well as a full-waveform track-end warning. You can also use other screen hacks to change the font size, color scheme, or layout of the screens.
 
Another way to customize your Traktor S4 is to change the mappings of the buttons, knobs, and faders. You can use the Controller Manager in Traktor Pro 3 to assign different functions to any control on the S4. For example, you can map the jog wheels to control effects parameters, or map the Mixer FX buttons to trigger Remix Deck samples. You can also download and install custom mappings from other users on websites like DJ TechTools or Traktor Bible.
