The interface of MOTU Electric Keys is simple and attractive, with a few basic controls such as volume, pan, tone and tremolo.

You can also adjust parameters via MIDI learn, and save and share your custom presets and combis.
 
One of the coolest features of MOTU Electric Keys is the virtual effects rack, which allows you to apply and chain multiple effects such as chorus, reverb, delay and more. You can also load and play Electric Keys sounds using MachFive 2 for advanced sound design and layering.
