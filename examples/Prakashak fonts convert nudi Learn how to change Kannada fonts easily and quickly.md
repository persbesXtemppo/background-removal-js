## Difference between Prakashak and Nudi Fonts
 
Prakashak and Nudi fonts are two types of Kannada fonts that have different encoding systems. Prakashak fonts are based on ASCII encoding, which means they use a fixed set of codes to represent each character. Nudi fonts are based on Unicode encoding, which means they use a universal standard of codes to represent each character. Unicode encoding is more compatible with different platforms and applications than ASCII encoding.
 
The main difference between Prakashak and Nudi fonts is that Prakashak fonts are font-dependent, while Nudi fonts are font-independent. This means that Prakashak fonts require a specific font to display the text correctly, while Nudi fonts can be displayed with any Unicode font. For example, if you have a text written in Prakashak font and you change the font to another one, the text will become unreadable. But if you have a text written in Nudi font and you change the font to another one, the text will still be readable.
 
Another difference between Prakashak and Nudi fonts is that Prakashak fonts are not compatible with Unicode fonts, while Nudi fonts are compatible with both ASCII and Unicode fonts. This means that Prakashak fonts cannot be converted to Unicode fonts directly, while Nudi fonts can be converted to ASCII fonts or Unicode fonts easily. For example, if you want to convert a text from Prakashak font to Nudi font, you need to use a tool like [http://www.kagapa.in/conversion/](http://www.kagapa.in/conversion/), which can convert ASCII/Nudi to Unicode or Unicode to ASCII/Nudi. But if you want to convert a text from Nudi font to Prakashak font, you can simply change the font in your application.

## Advantages of Using Unicode Fonts
 
Unicode fonts are fonts that follow the Unicode standard, which is a universal system of encoding and representing characters from different languages and scripts. Unicode fonts have many advantages over other types of fonts, such as ASCII fonts or Prakashak fonts. Some of these advantages are:

- Unicode fonts can support any language in the world, including complex scripts and symbols. Unicode fonts have over 1 million characters, while ASCII fonts have only 128 characters. This means that Unicode fonts can display text from multiple languages without any confusion or distortion.
- Unicode fonts are compatible with different platforms and applications, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, Java, XML, HTML, etc. Unicode fonts are also internet-ready and can be used for e-business and web development. Unicode fonts can be easily transferred and shared across different devices and systems without any loss of data or quality.
- Unicode fonts are standardized and consistent, which means that each character has a unique and fixed code that does not change with different fonts or encodings. This makes it easier to process and manipulate text using Unicode fonts. Unicode fonts also avoid the problems of character collisions or ambiguities that may occur with other types of fonts.
- Unicode fonts are portable and interoperable, which means that they can work with other applications and technologies that use Unicode. Unicode fonts can also be converted to other types of fonts or encodings using tools like [http://www.kagapa.in/conversion/](http://www.kagapa.in/conversion/). Unicode fonts can also benefit from new features and updates that are added to the Unicode standard.

These are some of the main advantages of using Unicode fonts for Kannada text or any other language text. Unicode fonts offer more flexibility, functionality, and reliability than other types of fonts.
