## Tips and Tricks for Playing Heroes 3 Ostrze Armagedonu
 
Heroes 3 Ostrze Armagedonu is a challenging and fun expansion pack that requires some strategy and planning to master. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your play and enjoy the game more:

- Use one stacks or stack splitting to protect your ranged units, distract enemy shooters, block enemy movement, or trigger enemy retaliation. One stacks are single units that you can place in different slots of your army. Stack splitting is dividing a stack of units into smaller stacks. You can do this by dragging a stack to an empty slot while holding the shift key.
- Pay attention to your movement points and slow units. Movement points are the amount of distance you can travel on the adventure map in one turn. They depend on your hero's logistics skill, artifacts, and the slowest unit in your army. Slow units are those with low speed or movement points, such as zombies or dwarves. They can reduce your overall movement and make you vulnerable to enemy attacks. You can either upgrade them, leave them in a town or garrison, or use magic or artifacts to boost their speed.
- Avoid terrain penalty and use native terrain to your advantage. Terrain penalty is the reduction of movement points when you travel on a different terrain than your native one. For example, if you play as Inferno, you will have less movement on grass or snow than on lava. Native terrain is the terrain that matches your town type and gives you a bonus in combat. For example, if you play as Conflux, you will have more morale and luck on magic plains than on other terrains. You can use magic or artifacts to negate terrain penalty or enhance native terrain effects.
- Use directional resource or artifact grabs to save movement points and time. Directional resource or artifact grabs are when you position your hero next to a resource or artifact on the adventure map and then click on it from a different direction than where you came from. This will allow you to pick up the item and move away from it in one turn, instead of wasting two turns to go back and forth.
- Learn the creature bank formation or unit pattern to plan your attacks and minimize losses. Creature banks are neutral buildings that contain creatures and treasures that you can fight and loot. They have a fixed formation or unit pattern that determines how many and what kind of creatures they have, as well as their placement on the battlefield. For example, a dragon fly hive has four stacks of dragon flies: one in each corner of the battlefield. Knowing this can help you decide which units to bring, which spells to cast, and which targets to focus on.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you play Heroes 3 Ostrze Armagedonu better. There are many more things to discover and learn in this amazing game. Have fun!
