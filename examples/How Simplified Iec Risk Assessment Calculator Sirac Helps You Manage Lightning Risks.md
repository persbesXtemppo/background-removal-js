# How to Use Sirac: A Tool for Simplified IEC Risk Assessment
 
Risk assessment is a crucial step in risk management, as it helps to identify and evaluate the potential hazards and consequences of various scenarios. However, risk assessment can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for large and diverse systems. That's why some experts have developed tools to simplify and streamline the risk assessment process, such as Sirac.

Sirac stands for Simplified IEC Risk Assessment Calculator, and it is a software application that is designed to function as a companion to the IEC 31010:2019 standard[^2^]. The IEC 31010:2019 standard provides guidance on the selection and application of techniques for assessing risk in a wide range of situations. Sirac helps users to apply some of these techniques, such as lightning protection risk assessment, in an easy and user-friendly way.
 
To use Sirac, users need to download and install the software from its official website[^1^]. Then, they can launch the application and select the type of risk assessment they want to perform. Sirac offers several options, such as building protection level (BPL), lightning protection zone (LPZ), or simplified risk assessment (SRA). Depending on the option chosen, users will need to input some data about their system, such as location, structure, occupancy, exposure, etc. Sirac will then calculate the risk level and provide a report with recommendations and suggestions for improvement.
 
Sirac is a useful tool for anyone who wants to conduct a simplified IEC risk assessment without having to deal with complex calculations and formulas. It can help users to comply with the IEC 31010:2019 standard and improve their risk management practices. However, users should be aware that Sirac is not a substitute for a comprehensive risk assessment by a qualified professional. Sirac is intended to provide an indicative result that may need further verification and refinement.
  
To illustrate how Sirac can be used in practice, let's look at some examples of risk assessment using the software. The following examples are based on the case studies presented in the IEC 31010:2019 standard[^2^], but they are simplified and adapted for demonstration purposes only.
 
## Example 1: Lightning Protection Risk Assessment for a Hospital
 
In this example, we want to assess the risk of lightning damage to a hospital building and its occupants. We use Sirac to perform a building protection level (BPL) assessment, which is a technique that determines the minimum level of protection required for a structure against direct lightning strikes. We input the following data into Sirac:
 
- Location: London, UK
- Structure: Rectangular building with flat roof, 50 m x 30 m x 15 m
- Occupancy: 200 people (100 patients and 100 staff)
- Exposure: High (surrounded by open space and taller buildings)
- Sensitivity: High (contains medical equipment and life-support systems)

Sirac calculates the risk level and provides the following report:

> The risk level for this structure is R = 0.0008, which is higher than the tolerable risk level of R = 0.0001. Therefore, this structure requires a high level of protection against direct lightning strikes. The recommended building protection level (BPL) is I, which means that the structure should be equipped with an air-termination system, a down-conductor system, and an earth-termination system, according to the IEC 62305-3 standard.

## Example 2: Lightning Protection Risk Assessment for a Solar Farm
 
In this example, we want to assess the risk of lightning damage to a solar farm and its components. We use Sirac to perform a simplified risk assessment (SRA) assessment, which is a technique that estimates the annual expected loss due to lightning effects on a system. We input the following data into Sirac:

- Location: Sydney, Australia
- System: Solar farm with 1000 photovoltaic modules, each with a nominal power of 250 W
- Exposure: Medium (located in a rural area with moderate lightning density)
- Sensitivity: Medium (contains electrical and electronic components that can be damaged by lightning surges)
- Cost: $500 per module (replacement cost)

Sirac calculates the risk level and provides the following report:

> The annual expected loss for this system is L = $1250, which is lower than the acceptable loss level of L = $5000. Therefore, this system does not require a high level of protection against lightning effects. The recommended lightning protection zone (LPZ) is 1, which means that the system should be protected by surge protective devices (SPDs) at its interfaces, according to the IEC 62305-4 standard.
